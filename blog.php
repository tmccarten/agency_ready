          <h3>The Digital Industry</h3>
          <p>The UK’s digital tech industries are expanding and evolving at a rate that shows no sign of slowing. Between 2011 and 2014 UK digital tech industries had a job creation rate 2.8 times faster than the rest of the economy, with 1.56m people employed in digital tech occupations [citation]. Translated into turnover that’s £161bn, a 32% faster growth rate than the rest of the economy and an average salary 36% higher than the national average [citation]. Needless to say, it’s all good news for people, like myself, hoping to forge a career in the digital tech industry.</p>

          <p>As an obvious symptom of such expansion, there are roles within businesses up and down the country waiting and needing to be filled. One of the surprising outcomes of Manchester Digital’s 2016 ‘Skills Summit’ survey was the significance of the ‘developer’ role to those businesses surveyed. Not only do they find it to be the most difficult role to fill, but they believe that the skillsets needed to fulfil the role will grow in importance more than any other. As someone who wishes to become a professional front-end web developer this was both revealing and reassuring to know that the need is very much there.</p>
