          <h3>About me</h3>

          <p>I moved to Manchester in 2014 to begin a BSc Web Development degree at Manchester Metropolitan University. As a mature student I often wonder why I didn't do this sooner. My work experience was totally at odds with my interests so I decided it was time to change that.</p>

          <p>I developed an interest in CSS around ten or so years ago when MySpace (I'm old) was king. The profiles allowed for customisation with CSS so I ended up spending far too long trialing, erroring and eventually getting somewhere. I suppose it was a more rudimentary version of what people do with WordPress templates today.

          <p>Iâ€™m always learning. No one wants to be left behind in such a <a href="blog/blog1_digitalindustry.php" title="Blog post by Thomas McCarten about digital industry">fast-moving industry</a>.</p>

          <p>Currently getting to grips with SASS, Gulp and Github in order to speed up and improve my workflow and design process. </p>
